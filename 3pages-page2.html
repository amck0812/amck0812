    <h1>Page Two - Dot</h1>
    <h3>Now say hello to my OTHER cat!</h3>

    <p>
        This is Kitty's son, Dot. Dot was a mysterious litter of only one. He was born with a black dot on his head, thus the name, <br>but it disappeared as he aged. Like his mom, he has yellow-green eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dot is a completely fearless cat who only listens to you when he feels like it. When he's not annoying dogs 10x his size, <br>he's begging for another meal. His appetite is insatiable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ever since I watched Dot be born and watched him grow firsthand, I knew he'd be a very interesting cat. <br>I'm glad that he's both so friendly and so fearless.
