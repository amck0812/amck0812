    <h1>Page One - Kitty</h1>
    <h3>Say hello to my cat!</h3>

    <p>
        This is my cat. Her name is Kitty. I've had her since she was a kitten, and she's about 8 years old now. <br>She's a brown tabby with medium-length fur and big yellow-green eyes.

        She is somewhat skittish and easily-startled, kind of like me. She's kind of weird in that she prefers kibble over wet food. <br>She's really talkative too. She's shy at first but super sweet when she gets to know you.

        I love Kitty a lot. She has been there for me through rough periods in my life, and I know that she could never judge me. <br>I'm glad to have such a cute and sweet cat!
