    <h1>Page Three - Angus</h1>
    <h3>And finally, say hello to my dog!</h3>

    <p>
        This is Angus. He's technically my Dad's dog, but I love him all the same. He's a half Border Collie, half Great Pyranees mix. He's also more than 100lbs!

        Angus was originally a working dog on a ranch, but was given away to us because of his playful nature. Instead of guarding sheep he was playing and distracting the other dogs. He's always been a silly puppy.

    <p>
        Angus is one of the sweetest, most loving, and most protective dogs I've ever had. I love being smothered by 100+ pounds of smelly fluffy dog. Every time I see him, I'm just as excited to see him as he is to see me.
